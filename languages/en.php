The \'Seven Stars\' pub had been vacant for 18 months, and local Councillor Marc Jones came up with the idea of re-open it as a Welsh Centre in order to build on the increased interest and pride in the language as a result of the Eisteddfod. He set up a Community Co-operative Company with a Management Board and shareholders. He persuaded Clwyd Alyn Housing Association to buy and renovate the listed building, which was then rented by the co-operative. \'Saith Seren\' opened at the end of January 2012.',

It provides a venue for Welsh language activities such as gigs, and sporting events on television with Welsh commentary on S4C. Clwb Clebran, every Thursday evening, gives Welsh language learners the opportunity to practice in an informal atmosphere outside the classroom. There are also many non-Welsh language activities e.g. darts, live bands on a Saturday night, but even on those nights, the Welsh spirit and culture is evident.',
